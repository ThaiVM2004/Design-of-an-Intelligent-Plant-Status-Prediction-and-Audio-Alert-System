# Design-of-an-Intelligent-Plant-Status-Prediction-and-Audio-Alert-System

This is a project about smart agriculture. In my project, i use a small machine learning model to embedded in ESP32 (WROM32) Devkit to predict the current health status of the plants.

## 🚀 Features:
- Read Soil Moisture sensor parameters.
- Read tempereture and humidity from DHT11 sensor.
- Read lighting parameters from Lighting sensor (LDR sensor).
- Using ThingsBoard to follow parameters sent from ESP32. 
- From the above parameters, i use machine learning model to predict the current health of the plants.
- Using speaker play audio to notify for person know the health status of the plants and care of thems.
## 🛠️ Hardware Components:
- ESP32 (WROM32) DEVKIT (30 pins).
- DHT11 sensor.
- Soil Moisture sensor.
- LDR sensor.
- Adapter 5V - 3A.
- Speaker (3W - 4 Ohm).
- DFPlayer.
- SD card.
